               CLASSIFICATION AND CODING INSTRUCTIONS
                 FOR FETAL DEATH RECORDS, 1999-2001




Section I - Introduction

     This manual documents specifications for coding and key entry of statistical items that will
be tabulated from the fetal death report by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). 
Primarily, these specifications are used by 49 registration areas of the United States (45 states,
District of Columbia, New York City, Puerto Rico and The Virgin Islands) that submit data to
NCHS in electronic form through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program (VSCP).  Under the
terms of the VSCP contracts with NCHS, the registration area must incorporate NCHS
specifications into their own procedures so that the resultant data files meet the needs of both
NCHS and the registration area.  Changes effective with 1999 are in bold print.


Section II - General Procedures for Electronic Files

     A.   Receipts

                    All registration areas except Arizona, California, Nevada, Ohio, Wyoming, and
          Guam provide coded data to NCHS in electronic form (tapes, diskettes and PC to
          PC).  These files include all of the fetal death events registered within their
          jurisdiction for each calendar year.  In general, data are transmitted on a monthly
          basis.  Transmittals take place at regular intervals and contain any and all records
          received and initially processed in the state office since the last transmittal to NCHS
          regardless of the month of the occurrence of the event.  A record need not be
          "perfect" to qualify for transmittal.  Each regular data transmittal shall contain all
          replacement records processed to date incorporating updated information from any
          source.  For purposes of full utilization and release of the data, states are expected
          to transmit the majority of records within six months of occurrence and a complete
          and final version of all records by July 31.



     B.   Processing

                         As the files are received at NCHS-RTP, they are automatically checked for
          completeness, individual item code validity, and unacceptable inconsistencies
          between data items.  The registration area is notified of any problems.  In addition,
          NCHS staff review the files on an ongoing basis to detect problems in overall
          quality such as inadequate reporting for certain items, failure to follow NCHS
          coding rules, and systems and software errors.  Traditionally, quality assurance
          procedures have been limited to review and analysis of differences between the
          NCHS and registration area code assignments for a small number of records.  In
          recent years, this procedures has been augmented by analyses of year to year and
          area to area variations in the data.  These analyses are based on preliminary
          tabulations of the data that are cumulated on a year to date basis each month.  All
          differences that are judged to have consequences for quality and completeness are
          investigated by NCHS.  In the review process, statistical tests are used to call
          initial attention to differences for possible follow-up.  As necessary, registration
          areas are informed of differences encountered in the tables and asked to verify the
          counts or to determine the nature of the differences.  Missing records (except those
          permanently voided) and other problems detected by NCHS should be resolved and
          corrections transmitted to NCHS in the same manner as for those corrections
          identified by the registration area.

Section III -File Layout and Coding Instructions

     This section provides the code structure, coding instructions, and output file locations for
each item in the national data set.
  
Changes were made to the following items effective in 1999 to expand all year fields to four digits:

Date of Delivery
Mother's Date of Birth
Father's Date of Birth
Date of Last Live Birth
Date Last Normal Menses Began

Note: The old locations for these years have been converted to "Filler" and should be blank.

     consider the entry to be an inclusion of the city named and code accordingly.
 
     2.  If the notation "rural" and "mail to _____" or "no pop." appears, code to the     
     balance of the county.
 
     3.  If only the notation "mail to _____" or "population included with _____"     
     appears, code to the balance of the named county.  ("Population included with" 
     refers to an unincorporated place.)
 
     4.  If the notation "Station," "Branch of _____" or "Rural Station" appears, code     to
     the balance of county.
 
     5.  If the notation "Station of _____ P. O." appears, consider the entry to be an
