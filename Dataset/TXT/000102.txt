                CLASSIFICATION AND CODING INSTRUCTIONS
                     FOR DEATH RECORDS, 1999-2001




Section I - Introduction

    This manual documents specifications for coding and key entry of statistical items that will
be tabulated from the death certificate by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). 
Primarily, these specifications are used by 54 registration areas of the United States (50 states, District of Columbia, New York City, Puerto Rico and The Virgin Islands) that submit 
data to NCHS in electronic form through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program (VSCP).  Under
the terms of the VSCP contracts with NCHS, the registration area must incorporate NCHS
specifications into their own procedures so that the resultant data files meet the needs of both
NCHS and the registration area. Changes effective with 1999 are in bold print.


Section II - General Procedures for Electronic Files

    A.   Receipts

                  All registration areas provide coded data to NCHS in electronic form (tapes,
         diskettes and PC to PC).  These files include all of the deaths registered within their
         jurisdiction for each calendar year.  In general, data are transmitted on a monthly
         basis (but twice monthly is preferred). Transmittals take place at regular intervals
         and contain any and all records received and initially processed in the state office
         since the last transmittal to NCHS regardless of the month of the occurrence of the
         event.  A record need not be "perfect" to qualify for transmittal.  Each regular data
         transmittal shall contain all replacement records processed to date incorporating
         updated information from any source.  For purposes of full utilization and release
         of the data, states are expected to transmit the majority of records within six months
         of occurrence and a complete and final version of all records by July 31.



    B.   Processing

                  As the files are received at NCHS-RTP, they are automatically checked for
         completeness, individual item code validity, and unacceptable inconsistencies
         between data items.  The registration area is notified of any problems.  In addition,
         NCHS staff review the files on an ongoing basis to detect problems in overall
         quality such as inadequate reporting for certain items, failure to follow NCHS
         coding rules, and systems and software errors. Traditionally, quality assurance
         procedures have been limited to review and analysis of differences between the
         NCHS and registration area code assignments for a small sample of records.  In
         recent years, this procedure has been augmented by analyses of year to year and
         area to area variations in the data.  These analyses are based on preliminary
         tabulations of the data that are cumulated on a year to date basis each month.  All
         differences that are judged to have consequences for quality and completeness are
         investigated by NCHS.  In the review process, statistical tests are used to call initial
         attention to differences for possible follow-up.  As necessary, registration areas are
         informed of differences encountered in the tables and asked to verify the counts or
         to determine the nature of the differences.  Missing records (except those
         permanently voided) and other problems detected by NCHS should be resolved and
         corrections transmitted to NCHS in the same manner as for those corrections
         identified by the registration area.

Section III -File Layout and Coding Instructions

    This section provides the code structure, coding instructions, and output file locations for each
  item in the national data set.  

    Changes were made to the items Date of Death (Year) and Date of Birth (Year) effective in 1999
  to expand the fields to four digits.  The old locations for the years have been converted to
  "Filler" and should be blank.

    Changes were also made to the items Linked File Year of Birth and Linked File State of Birth
  effective in 1999.  The Linked File Year of Birth was expanded to four digits, causing the
  locations for Linked File State of Birth to change.
