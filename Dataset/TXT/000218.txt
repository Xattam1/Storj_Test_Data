RLAC-13-15	St. Tammany	7.2	8	N/A			Added WWL between RLAC-13-03 and RLAC-13-15 using 6 and 8 ft contours.	No existing inundation polygon in this area. A series of HWMs and WWLs which were surveyed around Lake Pontchartrain form a good wind water line. 
RLAC-14-13	Vermilion	10.9	10	N/A			No action.  	Point falls inside of the inundation polygon that has RLAC-03-04 on the boundary.
RLAC-14-23  3	Orleans	5.6	2	N/A			No action.  	There are no other WWL points south of Lake Pontchartrain since this whole area was heavily flooded by Hurricane Katrina. Flaggers noted a  broken levee, which was possibly from Hurricane Katrina. 
RLAC-15-14  3	Lafourche	6.3	2	N/A			Designated as a WWL Data Point NUAR.	Point located in undeveloped, swampy area.   Nearby HWM points are concentrated in areas along highways/roadways. Point is a wrack line caught on fence (6' depth) and should not have been designated as a WWL.
RLAC-15-15  3	Lafourche	5.8	no contour available	N/A			Designated as a WWL Data Point NUAR.	Point located along highway surrounded by undeveloped, swampy area.  Point is a wrack line caught on fence (2' 7" to grade)- and should not have been designated as a WWL.
RLAC-15-16  3	Lafourche	6.4	no contour available	N/A			Designated as a WWL Data Point NUAR.	Point is surrounded by undeveloped, swampy area.  Point is a wrack line caught on a fence (5'2" to grade) and should not be designated as WWL.

RLAC-17-14	Plaquemines	1.2	2	N/A			Created new inland flood polygon extending from RLAC 17-09 to RLAC 13-01 using HWY 23 and marsh area polygon as boundary.	There was no existing inundation polygon in this area. A series of HWMs and WWLs, which were surveyed along State Highway 23, form a good wind water line. Water overtopped the levee but was stopped from spreading further inland by State Hwy 23. 
RLAC-17-17	Plaquemines	1.2	2	N/A			Created new inland flood polygon extending from RLAC 17-09 to RLAC 13-01 using HWY 23 and marsh area polygon as boundary.	There was no existing inundation polygon in this area. A series of HWMs and WWLs, which were surveyed along State Highway 23, form a good wind water line. Water overtopped the levee but was stopped from spreading further inland by State Hwy 23. 
RLAC-18-09	St. Mary	11.9		N/A			Designated as a WWL Data Point NUAR.	Point is a water line with a vertical distance to HWM of 9 feet. Other WWL points are further inland.  This point should not have been designated as a WWL point.
RLAR-02-03  2	Jefferson Davis	22.7	28	N/A			Designated as a WWL Data Point NUAR.	Point is far away from existing inundation polygon and coast and is also isolated from other points. Point was taken at a bridge and the flooding only reached up to the river bank. 
RLAR-02-05  2	Calcasieu	5.8	2	2	1,050	------	Designated as a WWL Data Point NUAR.	Point fall inside of inundation area. Flaggers notes wrack line here and the flood depth at point is 5.8 ft. This is flat area so the flooding could have gone 1000 ft inland. Point should not have been designated as a WWL point. 
RLAR-09-19	Calcasieu	12.3	14	2	15,000	------	Designated as a WWL Data Point NUAR.	The point is far away from existing inundation polygons and coast and is also isolated from other points. Flaggers noted wrack line here, which probably was caused by poor drainage.  
RLAR-12-09	Vermilion	9.8	10	N/A			Extended inland flood polygon from RLAC 1-03 using 10-ft contours around tributary.	Flooding occurred along tributary as indicated in flagger form and photos.  Flooding consistent with nearby HWMs RLAR-12-07 and RLAR-12-08.
RLAR-15-02  2	Livingston	4.1	2	N/A			Created inland flood polygon starting at RLAC 13-15 and connecting  RLAR 15-02 to RLR1 15-06.	As this point is on a tributary of a lake, the area has a low elevation and includes undeveloped marshland.  Flaggers noted this the point as a water line with a vertical distance to HWM of  0.5 ft. 
RLAR-15-03  2	Livingston	3.1	22	N/A			Designated as a WWL Data Point NUAR.	Flaggers noted this point as a water line with a vertical distance to HWM as 4.5 ft.  Point is at an elevation that is greater than the flooding elevation.  Poor drainage is suspected to be the cause of the observed HWM.  Point should not have been designated as a WWL. 
RLAR-15-04  2	Livingston	4.2	2	N/A			Designated as a WWL Data Point NUAR.	Point is in a very low area, just 0-2 ft from a canal.  Flaggers noted this as a water line with a vertical distance to HWM of 1.7 ft.  Point should not have been designated as a WWL.  
RLAR-15-06	St. Mary	5.7	6	N/A			Extended inland flood polygon to point using 6-ft contours and river boundaries.	Area has low elevations and includes undeveloped marshland. Flaggers noted this as a wrack line. Topography leads to the conclusion that this area should be included in the inundation polygon.  
RLAR-15-08	St. Mary	3.5	4	N/A			Extended inland flood polygon to point using 6-ft contours and river boundaries.	Area has low elevations and includes undeveloped marshland. Flaggers noted this as a wrack line. Topography leads to the conclusion that this area should be included in the inundation polygon.  
RLAR-15-09  2	Assumption	2.9	2	N/A			Designated as a WWL Data Point NUAR.	The surrounding area has low elevations and contains undeveloped marshland.  Although the land is very flat, the point is a considerable distance from the coast line and the observed wrack line is likely the result of drainage.  The point should not have been marked as a WWL.  No photos of site were available.  
RLAR-15-10  2	St. Martin	3.9	4	N/A			Designated as a WWL Data Point NUAR.	Area has low elevations and contains undeveloped marshland.  Flaggers noted this as a wrack line.  Although land is very flat, point is a considerable distance from the coast line and is likely the result of poor drainage.  Point should not have been designated as a WWL.  
RLAR-15-11	Assumption	2.7	2	N/A			Extended inland flood polygon to point using 6 foot contours and river boundaries.  	Area has low elevations and includes a lake, a canal, and undeveloped marshland. The proximity and flatness of the surrounding land indicate that this area should be included in the inundation polygon or the swamp polygon.  No photos of this site were available.  
RLAR-15-12  3	St. Charles	2.8	2	N/A			No action.  	There was no existing inundation polygon in this area.  The point is isolated from other points and flagger photos indicate flooding did not overtop bulkhead.
RLAR-20-11  2	St. Tammany	6.9	10	N/A			Designated as a WWL Data Point NUAR.	There is no existing inundation polygon in this area. Flaggers noted that the flood source is Pearl Rive, but point is isolated from other points.
RLR1-15-06  2	Livingston	5.2	4	N/A			Extended inland flood polygon to point using 6-ft contours and river boundaries.	As this point is near the lake, the surrounding area has a low elevation and includes undeveloped marshland.  Flaggers noted this as a water line with a vertical distance to HWM of 1.5 ft.  
								
								
								
CHWM's RLAC-11-21, 11-22, 11-23, 11-33, 11-27, and 11-25	Vermillion		6-8 ft	N/A			Extended debris line to follow CHWMs along State Highway 82 (approx 6-8' contour).	Flaggers found wrack and mud lines along Hwy 82 (road has a higher elevation than the surrounding area so it makes sense that debris would accumulate along the road). Land from coast to Hwy 82 is swampy, undeveloped area without access.
